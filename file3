Webhooks allow interaction between web-based applications through the use of custom callbacks. The use of webhooks allows web applications to automatically communicate with other web-apps. Unlike traditional systems where one system (subject) keeps polling another system (observer) for some data, Webhooks allow the observer to push data into the subjectâ€™s system automatically whenever some event occurs.
